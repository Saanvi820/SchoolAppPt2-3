                    <p class="list-group-theme-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The Central Jersey College Prep Charter School is offering a targeted summer program for all students to meet their individual needs and help to limit summer regression for all students. All summer programs run from Monday, July 13 - Friday, August 21, and will be either in-person or virtually depending on studentsâ€™ needs. The aim of all summer programs is to provide students an active, engaging, and productive summer program to meet their individual academic needs. In an effort to close the gap due to the closing of the school in March because of COVID 19, the school made it a priority to provide students with six weeks of ongoing instructional support in the summer. The school counselors used data from formative and summative assessments to place students either in Tier 1, 2, or 3.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-theme-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Tier 1 students were invited to CJCPâ€™s on-site program and Tier 2 and 3 students were assigned a teacher that would be providing virtual instruction. Both programs are six weeks and teachers developed targeted instruction to support the needs of the students and help students strengthen their skills and knowledge so they are ready for the fall. The in-person program offers targeted and intensive academic support to close the learning gap and help students make progress towards their learning goals. It provides a unique experience with an opportunity to receive substantial one-on-one attention and individualized instruction. But when school started, children are now bomabarded with work and they aren't able to do other things they like., </p>

                    <p class="list-group-theme-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">CJCP was approved for expansion by the New Jersey Department of Education (NJDOE) on March 1, and as a result, the students, faculty, and staff moved into a new facility designed to handle the anticipated demand of the school. "Today marks the culmination of an idea that began about a few years ago, Central Jersey College Prep Charter School (CJCP), Chief Education Officer or CEO, Dr. Namik Sercan said. "An idea about a new, state-of-the-art facility for the Central Jersey College Prep Charter School â€“ for the creation of an educational facility that will serve as a catalyst for increased student achievement and also economic growth in our region."</p>
